at the throat of the rising generation and preserve the integrity of
the American family. Not that there is a typical American family. There
is only the typical struggle between the dead and the living, between the
inert and hideous virtue of decayed souls and the rebellious desires of
their doomed progeny.
</p>

<p>
The ambitious and educated American mother is a forceful creature, a
strong, powerful woman. As an individual she is dead. Once she knew and
had the desire for beauty. Dead fingers reached into her heart and killed it.
The force of which she was doomed to become a part crushed her. The
conventions of the world are stronger than its natural destinies. Those
conventions—the conventions of the family—are not of the man’s making.
Woman attends to her own subjugation. She preserves the spirit of the
family, struggles and labors to keep it a unit, to keep its members alike.
Moaning with the tyrannical lust for possession she enfolds her daughter
in her arms. There are certain things in her daughter which must be
killed. There is a dawning of love for “impossible” things in her daughter’s
heart. There is an awakened mental curiosity, a perceptible inclination
to break from the oppressiveness of the surrounding dead. In the
night the daughter wonders and doubts. She would like “to get away”—to
go forth free of certain fiercely applied restrictions and meet a different
kind of folk, a different kind of thought. She would like to be—to feel the
things she is capable of. It is all vague. Always revolt is vague and intangible
for the daughters of women. Revolt is for souls still living, and
the living are weaker than the dead. The living soul is a lone, individual
force, its yearnings are ephemeral and undefined. The mother knows what
they are. The dead always know what it is they have lost. And in this
knowledge the mother is strong. But the living cannot say to itself what
it wishes to gain, what it reaches to attain. Only in the stray geniuses of
time has the individual soul fought desperately and triumphantly for its
<a id="page-2" class="pagenum" title="2"></a>
preservation. And there is no genius in the daughter. There is merely
the divine and natural instinct for self-realization. Once the mother felt
it and it was killed. Now the daughter has caught the dread disease—the
contamination which starts a cold sweat under the corset stays of society;
the thing which brings down upon it for its destruction the phalanxes of
fierce fatuities—the moribund mercenaries employed by the home for its
defense and preservation.
</p>

<p>
Something happens to crystallize the revolt. It is a man outside the
pale, a good man, a bad man. It is a book. It is a friend. Often the
struggle is fought through little things too numerous to mention and
the struggle itself too casual to classify. Sometimes it wages without a
word; at other times there are blows. And at such times the enshrouding
veils are torn aside. One can see the dead rise up, their pasty limbs dragging
with the mould and slime of their couch. One can see them reaching
their dead arms out, with the bloodless flesh hanging from them in shreds.
One can watch them crawl on their bony feet and as they come close—these
dead—the foul odor that issues from their sightless, twisted, rotted
faces hangs like a grey smeared canopy above them.
</p>

<p>
They come. They take their stand at the mother’s back. And the
pitiful struggle is on.
</p>

<p>
It is the mother who strikes the blows. Her first weapon (she uses
it like a poison) is her love. She calls it that. “You are my only happiness,”
she cries. “I have given you everything, a part of me, all you
have needed. I have sacrificed everything for you. All my dreams have
been for you. O, how can you permit anything to come between us?”
</p>

<p>
The daughter listens. There is a selfish ring to it. But love must be
forgiven for selfishness. In the schools and the churches the preliminaries
of the struggle have been insidiously fought. Children owe duties to
their parents and not to themselves. It was what the daughter learned
at school. It is what she read between the lines of her books and heard
from the lips of all around her. And now it is the murmur that rolls into
her ears. It is the odor of the dead.
</p>

<p>
Day after day the mother strikes with this weapon. Her red, furious
eyes dripping tears, she moans it out. Her voice is like the yelp of a
frantic animal. Her voice is like the whine of a woebegone fice. Her
voice is cold and hard and hollow like the echo in a tomb.
</p>

<p>
The beauty that has come to her daughter is a fragile thing. The lovliness
she visioned is the most delicately mortal of life’s treasures. Fiercely
the mother hurls herself against it, hurls the reproaches of her dead soul,
the recriminations of her entombed spirit—the odors of the dead.... And
her weapons are tangible things. They are sentences. They are the
moral perversions with which the family unit always has fought for its
preservation. They are tried things, prophetic precedents. And the beauty
<a id="page-3" class="pagenum" title="3"></a>
in the normal being is an indefinite force—a vagueness. It has no weapons
with which to strike. Triumphant revolt is only for martyrs and artists.
It is the losing force in normal existence.
</p>

<p>
Gradually it becomes clouded in the daughter’s soul. She feels unclean.
She imagines it is the beauty which is unclean. She does not know
that it is the uncleanliness of the dead—the uncleanliness of her mother
revealed to her in her heart by the divine light that is dying within herself.
An agony comes into her. The struggle narrows to pain. Cold
things reach at her heart. It leaps and flutters. She stands, her face
white and a look of uncanny suffering about her eyes. The dead fingers
grip fast.
</p>

<p>
The mother, moaning, shuddering, her eyes gleaming, enfolds her
daughter in her arms. “I dare you to take her from me,” she cries out
to the man, to the friend, to the book, to the world of beauty, whatever
it is toward which her daughter inclined for the divine instant of awakened
soul. “I dare you. I dare you.”
</p>

<p>
“Nothing can ever take me from you,” the daughter weeps. Death.
</p>

<p>
Tears, a form of decomposition now, roll from her cheeks. The
struggle is over. The unit has been preserved and now one may look at
the unit and see what it is. The rotted figures of the dead have dragged
their shredded flesh back to the graves.
</p>

<p>
There are different kinds of families. Only in the struggle between
the dead and the living do they become the same even when the contestants
differ. I will describe only one type. Perhaps it is <em>the</em> American family;
perhaps it is not.
</p>

<p>
It is the family which considers culture a matter of polished fingernails
and emotional suppression and dinner table aphorisms, puns and the
classics in half morocco. It has bound volumes of <em>The Philistine</em> or some
other mawkish philosophical twaddle on view in the bookcase. It—the
spirit of this family—knows the titles of books memorized from literary
reviews in current magazines and will discourse bitingly on the malicious
trend of these radical volumes from the sweeping knowledge she has of
their titles. In the matter of music the spirit of this family “plays safe.”
It will characterize as “tinkly” or “syrupy” anything melodious which
secretly pleases it. The rather humorous falseness of its culture is inexhaustible.
</p>

<p>
Introspection is an indecent as well as impossible thing to the spirit
of this family. To look into her soul and see the diseased and dead things
that fill it is naturally impossible and naturally indecent. Dostoevsky calls
man an animal who can get used to anything. And a man’s adjustment to
hideous things is not so final as a woman’s.
</p>

<p>
For the spirit of this family to reveal an honest reaction when it is
contrary to the approved artificial demands of a situation is as heinous
<a id="page-4" class="pagenum" title="4"></a>
an exhibition of bad taste as to uncover a thigh. But luckily, this concealing
of honest feeling is not often required. The spirit of this family
is incapable in the main of honest feeling. That is a part of the beauty
killed long ago in her, a part of the beauty she killed in the daughter, a
part of the beauty the daughter will strangle in her own children. And
one of the compensations for dead souls is that they naturally feel dishonest
feeling and do not have to suffer with a realization of hypocrisy.
</p>

<p>
This family thinks of virtue in terms of legs. This family regards art
and truth with a modulated leer. It is crudely cynical of everything outside
its range. It sneers and pooh-hoos, it ostracizes and condemns. It is
vulgarly contemptuous of the factors in life superior to it. The spirit of
this family would have shrieked in outrage at the presence of Verlaine in
its home—unless he could have reflected social distinction on it. It would
have closed the doors to Ibsen,—except for the social distinction,—to every
triumphant soul that had escaped the dead fingers and realized itself. And
by some inexplicable trick of self-adjustment the spirit of this family looks
upon thought as an undesirable affectation.
</p>

<p>
Social success means to this family a speaking acquaintance with any
wealthier unit which originally considered itself “above” this family. Moral
success means to this family an exemption from the prosecution of the
forces it has reared for its own protection—keeping out of jail, out of
scandal-<a id="corr-1"></a>mongering newspapers, out of the malicious after-dinner gossip of
its friends.
</p>

<p>
Of an evening you will find this family in the living room. The husband
and father reads a newspaper. He has worked in his office all day
and is tired. Life long ago ceased to mean anything to him. He is an
animal husk in fine linen. He has his little prejudices and his little conventions.
Indeed, he is a part of the system of the unit but not much interested
in it. He never was possessed of the capacity for beauty which his
women folk once had and which they found it necessary to kill in each
other. Man is a more natural part of the world’s ugliness. He is coarser
stuff in general. For him it is not necessary to wage any struggle. He
accepted matrimony because of a concentrated physical curiosity in one
woman, and because it was the thing to do at his age. Love suffered
epileptic dissolution in the nuptial couch. Honor toward his woman expired
when the mysteries of her flesh paled. Obedience is his natural
state—that is, long ago he established a line of least resistance and inoculated
his women folk with the fable that adherence to <em>this</em> line was the
obedience and respect he owed them. If a latent instinct awakens suddenly
in him he indulges himself. He finds it rather difficult to be immoral,
but as he hesitates a latent strength overcomes his fear and thus he is
able to be immoral and unfaithful to his own convenient restrictions in a
natural manner and with no great loss of sleep.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-5" class="pagenum" title="5"></a>
One man in ten thousand inherits the beauty of the woman who bore
him and he becomes an artist. It is not necessary for him to revolt. His
fathers have taken care of that. There is an assured place in the world for
him—not in the living room here in front of the fireplace but elsewhere,
in places of which poets sing.
</p>

<p>
The family man keeps posted. He knows what is going on in the
world but does not understand it. He is not capable of understanding. But
sometimes understanding and reason coincide with his prejudices and he
is then as liable to hold minority views as not. He is dry, sometimes
clever. But always he jogs, jogs, jogs along. He can even sleep night
after night in the same bed with his wife without feeling annoyance. His
bluntedness is complete. Dostoevsky is right.
</p>

<p>
His wife and the mother of his children is a part of the furniture of
existence for him. In his own way he is quite dead, but it was not necessary
to kill him. If his son revolts the instinct of his mother is communicated
to him and he fights. He borrows the mother’s weapons and he
blasphemes in a half-hearted way about the duty to parents. But the beauty
which the mother found easy to kill in the daughter usually discovers a
hardier citadel in the son and usually he carries it safely into the world.
</p>

<p>
The room—this living room—is dimly and “artistically” lighted. The
fire in the grate glows. The daughter sits in a corner speaking to a friend.
At the other side sits the father—reading blankly. The wife enters. She
surveys the scene from the doorway with a feeling of warm satisfaction.
She comes in and sits down. They talk about nothing, they think about
nothing. The daughter and the young man, beneath the smooth surface
of the artificial moments, are playing at the eternal indecency. The mother
leads the conversation. Neighbors are discussed. Friends are derided.
Social inferiors are laughed to scorn. Social superiors are spoken of with
adulation and veneration. At last the father climbs to his bed like an ox.
He is tired, poor fellow. The mother follows him into the bedroom. A
victor, utterly triumphant, she hugs her dead soul to herself and smiles.
The daughter retires after being desperately kissed by the physically curious
young man, and she lies awake a while wishing in moments of provoked
sex that she too was married and meditating in calmer spaces upon
the advantages of the family unit, the fireplace, the party calls. O, this
daughter! She is the one who had the vision of beauty. She is the one
whose soul sang for a day with the capacity for all the world’s lovliness.
Honesty, purity, fineness burned in her with their divine radiance. The
lights are turned out. Death reigns supreme.

The Piano and Imagism
</h2>

<p class="aut">
<span class="smallcaps">Margaret C. Anderson</span>
</p>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">O</span><span class="postfirstchar">nce</span> I said something vague about the piano music of the future.
There is something very definite to be said about it. I think the next
music written for the piano will have in it a high concentration of clear
color-sound and that the new pianist will focus his technique to just one
end: to the clearest expression of this color-sound identity. Sea mist, for
instance, has certain colors and certain smells; if you are keen-sensed it
has certain sounds. You may say it has been the aim of all composers and
musicians to put nature into music. Well, it has been the aim of most
poets to put nature into poetry, but the Imagists <em>have done it</em>: their medium
is not only a more direct one: the point is that they seem to have dispensed
with a medium. Their words don’t merely convey color to you; they <em>are</em> the
color. The new musician can do this—and I believe he can do it on the piano
better than on any other instrument. His music will be all these things:<a class="fnote" href="#footnote-1" id="fnote-1">[1]</a>
</p>

<p>
Sea orchards, and lilac on the water, and color dragged up from the
sand; drenched grasses, and early roses, and wind-harps in the cedar trees;
flame-flowers, and the sliding rain; frail sea-birds, and blue still rocks, and
bright winds treading the sunlight; silver hail stones, and the scattering of
gold crocus petals; blackbirds in the grass, and fountains in the rain; lily
shadows, and green cold waves, and the rose-fingered moon; pine cones,
and yellow grasses, and a restless green rout of stars; cloud whirls, and
the pace of winds; trees on the hill, and the far ecstasy of burning noons;
lotus pools, and the gold petal of the moon; night-born poppies, and the
silence of beauty, and the perfume of invisible roses; white winds and cold
sea ripples; blossom spray, and narcissus petals on the black earth; little
silver birds, and blue and gold-veined hyacinths; river pools of sky, and
grains of sand as clear as wine....
</p>

<p>
It will be made of dream-colored wings, and whispers among the
flowering rushes; of moonlit tree-tops, and the gaiety of flowers; brown fading
hills, and the moving mist; sea rose, and the light upon the poplars;
shaken dew, and the haunts of the sun, and white sea-gulls above the waves;
bright butterflies in the corn, and a dust of emerald and gold; broken
leaves, and the rose and white flag-stones; sea iris with petals like shells,
and the scent of lilacs heavy with stillness; scarlet nasturtiums, and dry
reeds that shiver in the grasses; slim colorless poppies, and the sweet salt
camphor flowers; gold and blue and mauve, and a white rose of flame;
pointed pines, and orange-colored rose leaves; sunshine slipping through
<a id="page-10" class="pagenum" title="10"></a>
young green, and the flaring moon through the oak leaves; wet dawns, and
a blue flower of the evening; butterflies over green meadows, and deep blue
seas of air, and hyacinths hidden in a far valley....
</p>

<p>
It will be of harsh rose and iris-flowers painted blue; white waters, and
the winds of the upper air; green wine held up in the sun, and rigid myrrh-buds
scented and stinging; the lisp of reeds, and the loose ripples of meadow
grasses; mists on the mountains, and clear frost on the grass blade; frail-headed
poppies, and sea-grass tangled with shore grass; the humming
brightness of the air, and the sky darting through like blue rain; strewn
petals on restless water, and pale green glacier-rivers; somber pools, and
sun-drenched slopes; autumn’s gold and spring’s green; red pine-trunks,
and bird cries in hollow trees; cool spaces filled with shadow, and white
hammocks in the sun; green glimmer of apples in an orchard, and hawthorn
odorous with blossom; lamps in a wash of rain, and the desperate sun that
struggles through sea mist; lavender water, and faded stars; many-foamed
ways, and the blue and buoyant air; grey-green fastnesses of the great
deeps; a cream moon on bare black trees; wet leaves, and the dust that
drifts over the court-yard; moon-paint on a colorless house....
</p>

<p>
It will be pagan temples and old blue Chinese gardens; old pagodas
glittering across green trees, and the ivory of silence; vast dark trees that
flow like blue veils of tears into the water; little almond trees that the frost
has hurt, and bitter purple willows; fruit dropping through the thick air,
and wine in heavy craters painted black and red; purple and gold and sable,
and a gauze of misted silver; blue death-mountains, and yellow pulse-beats in
the darkness; naked lightnings, and boats in the gloom; strange fish, and
golden sorceries; red-purple grapes, and Assyrian wine; fruits from Arcadia,
and incense to Poseidon; swallow-blue halls, and a chamber under
Lycia’s coast; stars swimming like goldfish, and the sword of the moonlight;
torn lanterns that flutter, and an endless procession of lamps; sleepy
temples, and strange skies, and pilgrims of autumn; tired shepherds with
lanterns, and the fire of the great moon; the lowest pine branch drawn
across the disk of the sun; Phoenecian stuffs and silks that are outspread;
the gods garlanded in wisteria; white grave goddesses, and loves in
Phrygia; wounds of light, and terrible rituals, and temples soothed by the
sun to ruin; the valleys of Ætna, and the Doric singing....
</p>

<p>
... The moon dragging the flood tide, and an old sorrow that has
put out the sun; whirling laughter, and the thunder of horses plunging;
old tumults, and the gloom of dreams; strong loneliness, and the hollow
where pain was; the rich laughter of the forest, and the bitter sea; the
earth that receives the slanting rain; lost treasure, and the violent gloom of
night; all proud things, and the light of thy beauty.... Souls of blood, and
hearts aching with wonder; the kindness of people—country folk and sailors
and fishermen; all the roots of the earth, and a perpetual sea....

The Moving-Picture Show

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">W</span><span class="postfirstchar">e</span> sat at a moving-picture show. Over a little bridge streamed the
Belgian refugees, women, children, boys, dogs, horses, carts, household
goods—an incongruous procession. The faces were stolid, the feet
plodded on—plodded on!
</p>

<p>
“See!” said my friend, “sometimes a woman turns to look at a bursting
shell.”
</p>

<p>
I murmured, “How interesting!”
</p>

<p>
And my soul shuddered. It shuddered at sophistication.
</p>

<p>
The man who had taken the pictures told us about them. He had been
not more than three weeks ago in Belgium....
</p>

<p>
“Huzza!” sang my ancestor of five thousand years back. He led a band
of marauders into an enemy’s village. They ripped things up and tore
about the place singing and looting. There was nothing much left to that
village by the time they got through with it.

there were no moving-picture shows in those days!

The Modern Woman With a Sense of Humor
</h3>

<p class="noindent">
There was a Modern Woman with a sense of humor.
</p>

<p>
“I shall,” she said, “teach to women the absurdity of bearing children
to be killed by cannon.”
</p>

<p>
“The absurdity!” exclaimed the men of the State, aghast at levity.
</p>

<p>
“Yes,” answered she, “it isn’t worth the trouble!” And she lifted her
eyebrows and smiled, but in her eyes there was Knowledge.
</p>

<p>
And the men of the State were more terrified by the phenomenon of
The Modern Woman with a Sense of Humor than by any phenomenon that
had before confronted them.

The Incredible Adventure of Spring
</h3>

<p class="noindent">
The year was again a-foot on the incredible adventure of Spring. The
earth broke into blossoming, and the nights were moon-drenched and astir
<a id="page-12" class="pagenum" title="12"></a>
with the whisperings of wet winds. It was a really thrilling time of the
year to be alive—and therefore, besides all these breathless and miraculous
adventures of the grass and flowers, many innocent and unsuspecting souls
had started out on the incredible adventure of being born.
</p>

<p>
But the war-writers kept on writing that for man to reach true exaltation
and vibrancy of spirit, he must blow out the brains of as many
people as possible.

He has builded him machines—man the Maker—using great cunning

that tool, the Intellect—through the dim ages of his making!
</p>

<p>
He has builded him states, politics, all the intricate architecture of institutions.
</p>

<p>
Now who would think that what he himself has builded—builded
through the thousands of years of endeavor—should thus turn about, ungrateful,
to destroy and to rend him?

<h3 class="section" id="THEANNUALBANQUET">
The Annual Banquet

“We shall not, this year,” said my rich friend—a Lady—“while the
people of Europe are starving and fighting—we shall not this year have
our large annual banquet.”
</p>

<p>
But had she walked not a mile from her home, she would have seen
in her own city men starving, and fighting because of the terrible dread of
starving. And not this year alone had they been doing it, but for many
years of large banquets.
</p>

<p>
However, if all Ladies and Gentlemen felt acutely all these matters,
what would become of our institution of Large Banquets—or, indeed, of
the Divine Privileges of Monarchs!

What a Veneer Is Civilization

“War,” wrote the journalists, “reveals what a veneer is civilization.
Man’s real emotions, instinctive, primitive, brutal, leap to ascendency.”
</p>

<p>
But I did not believe the journalists, because I knew better men’s emotions.
Indeed, what tore asunder my heart was the depth and beauty of the
emotions of men and women. There was nothing—at least very little—the
matter with their emotions.
</p>

<p>
But with their thinking apparatus—ah, that is a different story!

Lawson, Caplan, Schmidt

<p class="aut">
<span class="smallcaps">Alexander Berkman</span>
</p>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">I</span> don’t know of anything more tragic and pitiful than the superstition
that “Justice will triumph.” What this metaphysical conception of
“justice” really signifies, how it is to be expressed in applicable terms, is
impossible to determine in view of the multiplicity of individual antagonisms
and class interests.
</p>

<p>
But somehow we all believe in “justice”; yet the criterion of each is the
degree of the attainment of his own purpose.
</p>

<p>
From time immemorial we humans have been clamoring for “justice,”
divine and earthly. Hence our slavery. And Kaiser and Czar both claim
justice on their side, and millions are slaughtering each other to attain the
particular justice of their respective masters.
</p>

<p>
In this blessed land of ours, justice is ranked high, and labor is constantly
basing its appeals and demands on justice. But perhaps—let us
hope—the John Lawson case has somewhat jolted the popular faith in the
metaphysical conception, at least so far as it manifests itself in the Colorado
courts. It is safe to say that there is no intelligent man in that state who
does not know that the stage for Lawson’s conviction had been set long
before his trial. He was an intelligent, active agitator. He sought to crystallize
the rebellious dissatisfaction of the miners into effective action:—sufficient
reason for the Rockefeller-controlled state to eliminate, most emphatically,
such an undesirable element.
</p>

<p>
In Colorado, as well as throughout the rest of the country, most people
know that a great “injustice was done Lawson.” What are the people
of Colorado doing about it? Not a thing. The cheerful idiot, otherwise
known as the good citizen, cares for justice only in the degree in which it
affects his own pocket. And the masses of labor who do feel <a id="corr-8"></a>themselves and
their cause injured by the railroading of Lawson to prison—they call the
verdict a “miscarriage of justice”—applaud Professor Brewster who wired
Lawson: “Unbelievable. Counsel friends keep cool. Justice will be done.”
</p>

<p>
And the people of Colorado remain inactive, in the belief that the
Supreme Court, the Governor, or maybe the Holy Ghost will see to it that
justice is done.
</p>

<p>
Yet the Lawson lesson has not been entirely lost. It is possible that it
has shed a light that will reflect itself on coming fights between labor and
capital. It is more than probable that the lesson has already borne fruit in
the more aggressive attitude of labor in some parts of the country. It has
helped ever-growing numbers to realize that to expect “justice” in the struggle
between labor and capital means to doom the toilers to defeat.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-14" class="pagenum" title="14"></a>
It will be highly interesting to watch the effect of the Lawson outrage
upon the approaching trial of David Caplan and Mathew Schmidt, the aftermath
of the McNamara case, in Los Angeles, California. The history of
this case is illuminating of our legal and social “justice”:
</p>

<p>
The labor unions in California have for the last nine years fought a
bitter fight against the Merchants and Manufacturers’ Association, the
Western branch of the Steel Trust. Every means, legal and illegal, has
been used by the employers to exterminate the unions and paralyze the
workers. And they have practically succeeded in breaking every labor
organization in the Steel Industry from New York to San Francisco.
</p>

<p>
Where twenty years ago we had a powerful union—for instance, in
Pennsylvania: the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers—today
nothing but a pitiful remnant is left. Only <em>one</em> union in the steel
industry has survived: the Structural Iron Workers. They survived because
they contested every inch of ground against the Merchants and
Manufacturers’ Association. The result of that fight was a long war between
capital and labor on the Coast. Every form of persecution and violence
was used against labor, and labor was forced to defend itself. In
consequence the Structural Iron Workers increased their wages from $2.40
a day to $4.40, and reduced their hours from ten to eight. Organized capital
resorted to every trick to strangle the workers, and in Los Angeles a
special law was passed prohibiting picketing. But the union defied the
law, and five hundred men went to prison during the general strike of the
metal trades in Southern California in 1910. During this fight the Los
Angeles <em>Times</em>, the most relentless enemy of labor and of humanity, was
destroyed. The brothers McNamara were arrested, as a result, and then
the masters made the solemn promise that the war would be stopped and
that all further prosecutions of labor men would cease if the McNamaras
would plead guilty. It was only on the strength of this promise that the
McNamaras were finally induced to plead guilty.
</p>

<p>
Hardly ten days passed, when the Merchants and Manufacturers’ Association
broke every promise they made. They began the prosecution of
labor men in Los Angeles and Indianapolis, and did everything in their
power to railroad to prison the most effective members of the unions. And
now, four and a half years later, they have arrested David Caplan in
Seattle and Mathew Schmidt in New York, and brought them across the
country to Los Angeles to put them on trial for complicity with the McNamaras.
</p>

<p>
This perfidious activity of organized capital has made labor in California
realize that the courts are controlled by the employers, and that labor cannot
expect justice. They now understand what a fatal mistake was made in
the case of John Lawson. The workers depended on the innocence of Lawson
for his acquittal. They failed to act, expecting justice to be done.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-15" class="pagenum" title="15"></a>
At least some of the labor elements on the Coast are awakening to the
situation. They feel that they cannot expect justice from the courts of the
exploiters. They have now determined that more aggressive and militant
action is necessary, if labor is not to be submerged by the oppression of
capital. They are beginning to see that throughout the country the masters
are picking out the most effective and intelligent fighters from the ranks
of the workers and railroading them to prison, to terrorize labor and stifle
the spirit of liberty and independence. The Lawson case, the case of Ford
and Suhr, of Rangel and Cline, of Joe Hill, and the many other cases now
pending in the courts of New York and elsewhere, all show what capital
intends to do to labor.
</p>

<p>
Is labor really going to keep quiet and submit to this persecution and
slavery? The unions on the Coast have determined that they will not.
They are calling upon every one in sympathy with labor to join the great
movement to stop the aggression of capital. They have decided on strong
militant tactics to defend the workingman, his family and his union against
the tyranny of the bosses.
</p>

<p>
They have issued the call to every central body, affiliated unions and
radical organizations, to join hands at this most critical moment. This is
not a question of theory or of philosophic ism. It is the great war of labor
against capital, a struggle of life and death. In this struggle all local and
theoretic differences may be safely forgotten, and all friends of labor make
common cause.
</p>

<p>
I have been sent as a special delegate by some of the California unions
to help organize the solidaric and militant forces of labor throughout the
country. It is evident how significant this case is for the workers in general.
It is imperative that they combine in solidaric unity in this vital matter, to
register in mighty accents the sentiments and determination of the oppressed.
Thus were Haywood, Moyer, and Pettibone torn from the clutches
of the jungle beast. Thus were returned to liberty Ettor and Giovannitti,
Carlo Tresca, and other fighters for the better day. But whenever the
workers failed to sound the tocsin of solidarity and make their gesture of
protest, their prisoners of war have invariably remained the hostages of
the enemy.
</p>

<p>
Organizations and individuals who are willing to give us their moral
and financial assistance, should immediately send resolutions and funds to
Tom Barker, Secretary Building Trades Council of Los Angeles, and
Treasurer of the Caplan-Schmidt Defense Fund. Address, 201 Labor Temple,
Los Angeles, California. My own address for the present is 917 Fine
Arts Building.

Nudity and the Ideal
</h2>

</div>

<p class="aut">
<span class="smallcaps">Will Levington Comfort</span>
</p>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">O</span><span class="postfirstchar">ne</span> of the young men here loved the sunlight on his shoulders so well—had
such a natural love for the feel of light and air upon his bare
flesh—that he almost attained that high charm of forgetting himself half-dressed....
The country people occasionally come down to the
water on the Sabbath or to sell (from their homes back on the automobile
routes and the interurban lines) and for what they do not get of
the natural beauty of shore and bluff, I have a fine respect. However they
didn’t miss the Temporary Mr. Pan.
</p>

<p>
They complained that he was exposing himself, even that he was shameless.
</p>

<p>
Now, I am no worshiper of nudity. I’d like to be, but it disappoints in
most cases. There is always a strain about an object that is conscious of
itself—and that nudity which is unconscious of itself is either shameless,
an inevitable point of its imperfection anatomically for the trained eye; or
else it is touched with divinity and does not frequent these shores.
</p>

<p>
The human body has suffered the fate of all flesh and plant-fiber that is
denied light. A certain vision must direct all growth—and vision requires
light. The covered things are white-lidded and abortive, scrawny from
struggle or bulbous from the feeding dream into which they are prone to
sink.
</p>

<p>
It will require centuries for the human race to outgrow the shames
which have come to adhere to our character-structure from recent generations.
We have brutalized our bodies with these thoughts. We associate
women with veils and secrecy, but the trouble is not with them, has not
come from women, but from the male-ordering of women’s affairs to
satisfy his own ideas of possession and conservation. The whole cycle
of human production is a man-arrangement according to present standards,
and every process is destructively bungled. However, that’s a life-work,
that subject.
</p>

<p>
The thoughts of our ancestors have debased our bodies in color and texture
and contour organically and to be seen. Nudity is not beautiful, and
does not play sweetly upon our minds because of this heritage. The human
body is associated with darkness, and the place of this association in our
minds is of corresponding darkness.

<p>
The young man and I talked it over. We decided that it would be a
thankless task for him to spend the summers in ardent endeavor to educate
<a id="page-24" class="pagenum" title="24"></a>
the Countryside by browning his back in public. <em>That</em> did not appeal
to us as a fitting life task; moreover, his project would be frequently interrupted
by the town-marshal. As a matter of truth, one may draw most
of the values of the actinic rays of the sun through thin white clothing;
and if one has not crushed his feet into a revolting mess in pursuit of the
tradesmen, he may go barefooted a little while each day on his own grassplot
without shocking the natives or losing his credit at the bank. The real
reason for opening this subject is to express, without hatred, certain facts
in the case of the Countryside which complained.
</p>

<p>
They are villagers and farm-people who live with Mother Nature without
knowing her. They look into the body of Nature, but never see her face
to face. The play of light and the drive of intelligence in her eyes is
above the level of their gaze or too bright. Potentially they have all the
living lights—the flame immortal, but it is turned low. It does not glorify
them as men or parents or workmen. It does not inspire them to questing—man’s
real and most significant business. They do not know that
which is good and evil in food, in music, in color, fabric, books, in houses,
lands or faith. They live in a low lazy rhythm and attract unto themselves
inevitably objects of corresponding vibration. One observes this in
their children, in their schools, and most pathetically in their churches.
They abide dimly in the midst of their imperfections, but with tragic
peace. When their children revolt, they meet on every hand the hideous
weight of matter, the pressure of low vibrations, and only the more splendid
of them have the integrity of spirit to rise above the resistance.
</p>

<p>
As for the clothing they wear, they would do better if left suddenly
naked as a people and without preconceptions were commanded to find
some covering for themselves. As herds, they have fallen into a descending
arc of usage, under the inevitable down-pull of trade. Where the vibrations
of matter are low, its responsive movement is gregarian, rather than
individual. The year around, these people wear clothing, woolen pants
and skirts, which if touched with an iron, touched with sunlight, rain or
any medium that arouses the slumbering quantities, the adjacent nostril
is offended.
</p>

<p>
They are heavy eaters of meat the year round. They slay their pets
with as little concern as they gather strawberries. Their ideas of virtue
and legitimacy have to do with an ecclesiastical form, as ancient as
Nineveh and as effaced in meaning. They accept their children, as one
pays a price for pleasure; and those children which come from their
stolen pleasures are either murdered or marked with shame. Their idea
of love is indefinite with desire, and their love of children has to do with
the sense of possession.
</p>

<p>
They are not significant men in their own fields; rarely a good mason, a
good carpenter, a good farmer; the many have not even found the secret
<a id="page-25" class="pagenum" title="25"></a>
of order and unfolding from the simplest task. The primary meaning of
the day’s task in its relation to life and blessedness is not to be conceived
by them. They are taught from childhood that first of all work is for
bread; that bread perishes; therefore one must pile up as he may the
wherewith to purchase the passing bread; that bread is bread and the rest
a gamble.... They answer to the slow loop waves which enfold
the many in amusement and opinion, in suspicion and cruelty and half-truth.
To all above, they are as if they were not; mediocre men, static
in spiritual affairs, a little pilot-burner of vision flickering from childhood,
but never igniting their true being, nor opening to them the one true way
which each man must go alone, before he begins to be erect in other than
bone and sinew.
</p>

<p>
They cover their bodies—but they do not cover their faces nor their minds
nor their souls; and this is the marvel, <em>they are not ashamed</em>! They
reveal the emptiness of their faces and the darkness of their minds without
complaining to each other or the police.
</p>

<p>
From any standpoint of reality, the points of view of the many need
only to be expressed to reveal their abandonment.... You see, I have
left the Countryside and am lost in the crowd now, any crowd, the world-crowd,
whose gods today are trade, patriotism and a certain limp-legged
tumbler.
</p>

<p>
... Yet we are told by every authoritative voice out of the past, and
we know it from the urge of our own souls, that we must love the many
before we can serve them. It is fatuous to love blindly, therefore we must
understand what we are about. I have touched here some small things
of the crowd, which are well enough to know; otherwise we are apt to
stand apart from the many crying: “How noble are the simple-minded!
How sweet the people of the Countryside! How inevitable and unerring
is the voice of the people!” As a matter of truth, unless directed by
some strong man’s vision, the voice of the people has never yet given utterance
to constructive truth; and the same may be said of those who cater
to the public taste in politics or the so-called arts. The man who undertakes
to give the people what the people want is not an artist or a true
leader of any dimension. He is a tradesman and finds his place in his
generation.
</p>

<p>
The brave workman who dares be himself and go hungry for the
honor finds sooner or later a brilliant little fact rising in his consciousness—one
that comes to stay, and which future thinking must be built around:
that while the people are all that is low and bad in their change and rush
of personality, they are also the soil of the future, a splendid potential
mass that contains every heroism and masterpiece to be; that all great
things must come from the people, because great leaders of the people
turn their passionate impregnation of idealism upon them; that first the
dreamer dreams—and then the people make it action....
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-26" class="pagenum" title="26"></a>
That which we see that hurts us so as workmen, is but the unfinished
picture, the back of the tapestry.
</p>

<p>
To be worth his spiritual salt, the artist, any artist, must turn every
force of his conceiving into that great restless Abstraction, the many; he
must plunge whole-heartedly in the doing, but cut himself loose from the
thing done; at least, he must realize that what he is willing to give could
not be bought.... When he is quite ready, there shall rise for him,
out of the Abstraction, something finished; something as absolutely his own
as the other half of his circle.

The Ugliest Man

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">G</span><span class="postfirstchar">ood</span> and evil, these are time-old opposites. So are beautiful and ugly.
But these two opposites are seldom entirely coincident. No doubt
there are good and high-class men who are commonly judged to be fundamentally
ugly. And there are blinding beauties who are on a war-footing
against all that we call good. The good satisfies our moral judgment; the
beautiful, our judgment of taste. The one has to do with the content of
human life; the other, with the form. But, at bottom, the moral judgment
and the judgment of taste cannot remain entirely and materially dissociated.
It was a more nearly correct feeling on the part of the Greeks when they
let the beautiful and the good inter-grow. According to the Greek, the
good and the beautiful, intimately united, constitute the ideal of virtue,
however. We are reconciled after a fashion to the ugliness of a man if we
find a great and noble soul in the repellant shell.
</p>

<p>
But if permanent beauty is to be preserved to human nature, efficient
and high endeavor, free self-concentrated formation of character is the only
means to this end. When the “outer man” mirrors goodness and beauty of
heart, firmness and bravery of will, seriousness and depth of thought, his
countenance glows under all circumstances with a radiance of happy beauty,
and it would be a barbarian and pitiable eye indeed that could not apprehend
such radiance or feel itself smitten with its glory. For the man of fine
feeling, therefore, all that is ugly affects him morally at the same time. Indeed,
the reproach of having behaved in an ugly manner he feels as keenly,
frequently more keenly in fact, than the reproach of having behaved immorally.
</p>

<p>
In the case of <em>Friedrich Nietzsche</em>, the moral criterion of human worth
was totally transformed into an aesthetic criterion! This man who had
subdued all “morality” and left it behind him, who took his stand “beyond
good and evil,” submitted to a new evaluation, was measured according to
his greatness. Greatness was nobility, supremacy, beauty. Smallness was
vulgarity, baseness, ugliness. Not the wickedest, and not the wretchedest,
but the ugliest man—<em>der hässlichste Mensch</em>—represents the power which
the new culture has to struggle with—to overcome, indeed—if man is to
mount to a higher plane of being.
</p>

<p>
Who is this ugliest man? Of all the Zarathustrian enigmas, this is
perhaps the most enigmatic. It must have been a frightful ugliness which
haunted and harried the poet-philosopher when he narrates that, amid his
wanderings over men’s disappointing earth, he had met the ugliest man.
<a id="page-31" class="pagenum" title="31"></a>
Many and many were the types of human beings that Zarathustra had met
in his lonely pilgrimages. Most of them he disposed of with high scorn
or honest contempt,—thus did he dispatch the good and reputable, the custodians
of the old tables of morals and order; then, the preachers of the
doctrine of equality, who swarmed around like flies in market places, shunning
all solitudes, able to exist only in masses; next the poisonous tarantulas
who, with envious revenge, devised punishments, in cold blood dragged
their victims to justice; finally, the wise and upright, the schoolmasters,
whose duress converted all depths into shallows, managed to obliterate all
men’s peculiarities, till nothing distinctive was left.
</p>

<p>
But the ugliest man was uglier than any of these! These types did
not so infuriate Zarathustra as did the ugliest man. At all these Nietzsche
shook his head, but they did not floor him. He had been able to look upon
them, to scold them, to laugh at them. “And again did Zarathustra’s feet
run through mountains and forests.... When the path curved round
a rock, all at once the landscape changed, and Zarathustra entered into a
realm of death. Here bristled aloft black and red cliffs, without any grass,
tree, or bird’s voice. For it was a valley which all animals avoided, even the
beasts of prey, except that a species of ugly, thick, green serpent came here
to die when they became old. Therefore the shepherds called this valley
‘Serpent-death.’” Here Zarathustra found the ugliest man something sitting
by the wayside shaped like a man, and yet hardly like a man, something
nondescript. And all at once there came over Zarathustra a great
shame, he blushed up to the roots of his white hair, he would flee this ill-starred
place—the worst that there was in the whole world! But the Great
Despiser, the Hater of all pity was himself so unstrung and overpowered
by pity that he sank down all at once, like a giant oak that had weathered
many a storm, or withstood many a stroke of the woodman’s axe.
</p>

<p>
Who was this ugliest man? What was this ugliest thing which
Nietzsche—the great man-spy and life-appraiser—had ever discovered in
a human being? Before Nietzsche wrote, <em>thus spake Zarathustra</em>, he expresses
himself in another work as follows: “Nothing is ugly save the degenerate
man.... From the physical standpoint everything ugly
weakens and depresses man. It reminds of decay, danger, impotence; he
literally loses strength in its presence. The effect of ugliness may be gauged
by the dynamometer. Whenever man’s spirits are downcast, it is a sign
that he scents the proximity of something ‘ugly.’ His feeling of power,
his will to power, his courage and his pride—these things collapse at the
sight of what is ugly, and rise at the sight of what is beautiful....
Ugliness is understood to signify a hint or a symptom of degeneration;
that which reminds us, however, remotely of degeneracy, impels us to the
judgment ‘ugly.’ Every sign of exhaustion, of gravity, of age, of fatigue;
every kind of constraint, such as cramp, or paralysis; and above all the
smells, colors and forms associated with decomposition and putrefaction,
<a id="page-32" class="pagenum" title="32"></a>
however much they may have been attenuated into symbols,—all these things
provoke the same reaction, which is the judgment ‘ugly.’ A certain hatred
expresses itself here: who is it that man hates? Without a doubt it is
<em>the decline of his type</em>. In this regard his hatred springs from the deepest
instinct of the race. There is horror, caution, profundity, and far-reaching
vision in this hatred,—it is the most profound hatred that exists.”
</p>

<p>
Nowhere has Nietzsche told us of the zenith, who his superman is.
But he here tells us of the nadir, who the ugliest man is—and the superman
is the exact and august opposite. Thus we could ourselves construct his
superman.
</p>

<p>
But the ugliest man—we recognize this strange figure of the Zarathustra
poesy in the sharp cry of distress which all representatives of degenerate
(<em>de-genera</em>) humanity groan out where the yearning toward a higher
humanity overpowers them. The ugliest man then appears accoutered with
a crown with which he has crowned his own head, and with two purple
girdles which encircle him. In a later profound observation, Nietzsche informs
us that the ugliest man is called <em>der historische Sinn</em>, the historical
mind, or sense, which needs decoration, accoutrement, like all ugly things
that would make themselves tolerable, at least for surface people. The degenerate
man,—this is the ugly man, and the saddest degeneration is <em>the
surrender of life to the past</em>—for the past is the big grave which swallows
up all that lives. Whoever makes the past the goal of his longing walks
among corpses which make him shiver. He becomes himself a corpse, whose
society is freezing for living men. And because this man, assimilated to
the past, living in the past, is nothing himself, he needs all kinds of fiddle-faddle
to give himself the semblance of being something. He needs pomp
which makes a world-stirring phenomenon out of a coronation; he scrambles
and scratches after titles and orders—which long ago Frederick the
Great, the philosopher-king on the Prussian throne, called the insignia of
fools; he has himself accredited by father and grandfather, so that their
merit may adorn the shield of son and grandson; in a word, he reverses
the counsel of an apostle: “Forgetting the things that are behind,” for
he forgets the things that are before and reaches back for the things that
are behind. And because there is for this backward-bent man an inconvenient
monitor and witness of all life—because there is God, the omnipresent
God, who ever sees all, even sees man through and through, this
ugliest man became the murderer of God, he took revenge on the living
God for being witness of the hiddenest life of man! “I know thee well,”
said Zarathustra, with a brazen voice, “<em>thou <a id="corr-13"></a>art the murderer of God</em>!...
Thou couldst not <em>endure</em> him who beheld thee through and through, thou
ugliest man. Thou tookest revenge on this witness!”
</p>

<p>
We have here, I think, with all that is enigmatic and obscure, a sharply-outlined
picture of the ugliest man. Earlier Nietzsche wrote a book on the
blessing and the bane of history for life. In that book he accorded right to
<a id="page-33" class="pagenum" title="33"></a>
historical culture and to man’s knowledge of the past <em>only in so far</em> as the
life of the man of the present and of the future would be advanced thereby.
But the historians in the schools, in chair and pulpit, did not so think.
They acknowledged life only when it was dead! A zealous teacher of history
was a meandering mummy from out the past, who had no blood more
in his veins, no flesh more on his bones. Therefore was he so ugly. Therefore
did he create such a frosty temperature round about him. Under the
pressure of these historical forces, all life became a <em>cultus</em> of the past. The
older a thing was, the better it was. It was the long past, the outlived, that
was noble. The more remote that past, the prouder men were of it, and the
brighter shone its glory-beaming star to the eyes of men.
</p>

<p>
From this malady of the ugliest man, from this <em>de-genera-tion</em>, we are
by no means free. Instead of ascent to a higher <em>genus</em> than present man,
to superman, there is descent to a lower <em>genus</em>. This antiquarian, hoary
spirit pervades our whole social life, this <em>re-spect</em> for what has become old
and rotten, for what can show no other merit than that it once—was! It is
a sign of our own decay, this living on the dead, this ability only to resuscitate
and copy past centuries—past poetry, past art, past philosophy, past
morality, past religion!—this knowing in consequence no life of our very
own. We build “whitewashed sepulchers” in our lives, because we have
no courage of heart to create anything that belongs to life. At all events,
that the putridity and the dead bones may be concealed, we use whitewash,
much whitewash! We use decorations, brilliant, finely-painted decorations
so that men may not observe that life has become a theatrical play, making
an impression indeed under clever management, but inspiring no living
human heart. All the splendor of this pomp, which we of today employ
on the stage of life, cannot conceal the chilly vacuity of this whole business;
and the man who peers behind the curtains and sees how people look shorn
of their decorations, without powder and paint, without the artificial cunning
luminosity of the day’s puffery, has Zarathustra’s feeling in the valley
forsaken to the old green thick snake on its way to die,—Zarathustra’s feeling
when he met the ugliest man, where much heaviness settled on his
mind, because he did not think that anything so ugly and horrible could
exist among men.
</p>

<p>
Yes, there are traces and traits of this ugliest man among us. If we
but imagine all that is decoration, flummery, stripped off from us, think how
much degenerate life would be disclosed! How much love for the dead
<em>that no longer lives</em>, how much bitter strife and war over <em>reliques</em>, over some
sacred cloak, or sacred bone, of which history narrates, telling us that they
once belonged to life. How much slavish obedience to thoughts that once
were; to institutions that once served the living. To be sure, men call this
<em>piety</em>, and have thus designed a beautiful robe behind which they hide their
moribund lives. For the sake of this piety, they exact consideration for
all ancient dust which burden the homes and hearts of men, they arm themselves
<a id="page-34" class="pagenum" title="34"></a>
against him who, with mighty hand, would undertake a huge house-cleaning
of life and for life. Piety,—it is this that they call admiration and
veneration of every idol which for long has been played out, but still counts
us of today among its devotees. Men must even deal God a mortal blow,
the <em>Living</em> God of the living, and, with the ferocious hatred of their folly,
pursue the God who sees their innermost heart as a living witness of what
they would like to hide from themselves and all the world. “But he—<em>had
to</em> die: he looked with eyes which beheld <em>everything</em>,—he beheld men’s
depths and dregs, all his hidden ignominy and ugliness ... he crept
into my dirtiest corners. This most prying, over-intrusive, over-pitiful
one had to die. He even beheld me: on such a witness I would have revenge—or
not live myself. The God who beheld everything, <em>and also man</em>:
that God had to die! Man cannot <em>endure</em> it that such a witness should live.”
</p>

<p>
Thus spake the ugliest man. Zarathustra started off, feeling frozen to
the very bowels.
</p>

<p>
The God who told men that altogether they served death, not life, that
they worked deterioration, not rejuvenation—had to die! Life is a dying—and
yet there shoots through the heart of man such a nameless anxiety in
the presence of this dying that he paints up and pencils all death till it
looks like life. And indeed many are deceived, many see only men’s rouge
and mark not the great lie which it hides. This is the ugliest thing in the
world, and it made the prophet of a new culture shudder and freeze—<em>this</em>,
that we live and walk among corpses which yet look as if they were
alive!
</p>

<p>
To fight and conquer this hindrance to a new culture, this is to fight and
conquer death; and since death is death only through man, through his
yearning or fear, the triumph of a new culture begins with the triumphal
song of life, which knows how to make a festival out of even death. To
be sure, Nietzsche did not set his most beautiful man over against his most
ugly, but we can yet read between the lines what he conceived the most
beautiful man to be. He is the man who has pushed far from him the last
vestige and survival of fear and slave-service. He is the man who has
learned dying as the great Consummator, victorious, surrounded by men
who hope and vow that there shall ever be festival where a man who
so dies dedicates himself to the living. Here Zarathustra-Nietzsche intimates
a kinship with that other Dying Man Who proclaimed his life’s
victorious career in His: “It is finished!” and created on Christianity’s
Good Friday a festival of death. Nietzsche speaks of the Hebrew, too early
dead, who would have confessed Zarathustra’s doctrine, if he had attained
to Zarathustra’s years. It did not occur to Nietzsche that such a confession
was not at all needed, because the world had perceived the glad message
already which would make a festival out of death and teach men how the
most beautiful festival was consecrated. Christian art had opposed to the
ugliest man the most beautiful human picture: the head full of wounds
<a id="page-35" class="pagenum" title="35"></a>
and blood, the King in the thorn-crown, who understood dying because he
understood living. With this victorious song of death began a new culture,
a new heroism of humanity, to which death ceased to be a pale ghost, but
which confessed even in death: “as dying, and behold, we live!” Then
men ceased to learn dying, and because they made no preaching of life out
of dying and no vow to life, death became to them a torturing anxiety and
care again; they did not dare name his name; they did not dare frankly
look him in the eye. And this cowardice and lie disfigure all their action
and passion; they would give to death at least the semblance of life; they
would believe in ghostly existence still allotted to all the dead, rather than
say to death: “Thou are a messenger of God, a revelation, a witness of
life; since thou art good, I will greet thee and bless thee!”
</p>

<p>
So Zarathustra demanded of his disciples: “Let your dying be no
blasphemy of men and earth; my friends, your spirit and your virtue shall
still glow in your dying, like the evening red over the earth, or else death
has miserably betrayed you.”
</p>

<p>
Death our will even, our freedom—this is life’s highest meaning! Who
but Nietzsche could have thought that? Of course, this is not to throw
life away, when it has become hard and heavy to bear. Such a death would
be of all the most unfree. It would be a flight, not a deed; it would be a
lamentation and a feebleness, not a festival of the soul! But it means that
we take up death from the start into the order of our life, as the night which,
no less than the day, belongs to man’s full day. It means that we give to
life a worth which no death can destroy, which first in death reveals its
eternal power. I must die—so laments the slave, who has lived only non-entities
even in his life, and has never learned that life is work, creation,
consummation. I <em>will</em> die—so speaks the hero, to whom every fight brings
the prize of a victory well worth death!—the hero who hazards his life
every moment for the highest human good, who knows that he and his life
have become a sacrifice from which a better, higher, freer humanity shall
gain its life and its strength.
</p>

<p>
Who is ugly? Who is beautiful? Who is ashamed of his death and
falsifies his deadness that it may look like life—who does this, bears death
within himself as a power that drags him down, disfigures him in the fullness
of that which he would be able to live. But who, in his power to die,
proves that he has learned to live, has overcome the ugliest thing in man,
cast it out; namely, the fear of death which creates all the lies of life, and
all the servility and unfreedom of men—which creates men over whom <em>das
Gewesen</em>! the dead past, possesses power, so that they can never breathe
a joyous breath, can never commit themselves to the living and the growing.
But a <em>beautiful</em> culture will also become a <em>good</em> culture because one that is
living is at once good and beautiful; the eternal life of God, of whom it is
said: There is none good but God alone.

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">D</span><span class="postfirstchar">ear</span> Mr. Ibsen: I hope this letter finds you well as it leeves us
the same. The reason why I write you is that I seen your play called
<em>Ghosts</em> at the Bijou Movie Theater last night and I thought it was so grand
that I had to tell you. I thought it was awful the way poor Mr. Alving is
always seeing that hand which was pulling his hair out of the past. And
it was awful too the way poor Mr. Alving crawled across the floor on his
stomich and pulled the poison offn the icebox before he killed himself. The
way his poor, dear mother suffered, that was terrible. She was such a
strong, brave woman that I cried for her all the time. And The Rev. Manders
he was such a real swell minister that my heart was all torn watching
him. It ain’t natural for everybody to be so good as ministers because they
ain’t got so much time and don’t read the Bible so often. But he was certainly
all there when it came to pureness and kindness. But even if the
play was awful it was just grand the lesson that it taught. I sent my friend
to see it and he thought it was swell. He said the kissing scenes where the
terrible Cap. Alving hugs the different ladies was real stuff and that
the lesson against the evils of drink was good for the young. This
is what I want to write you about, Mr. Ibsen. We’re going to organize
a West Side Ibsen Prohibition Club and make you honary president. I
wish therefor you will write the club a letter or better if you will write a
sequil to the movie play <em>Ghosts</em> we will put it on at the club. I know how
hard it is to have movie plays accepted because I have done some myself
but if you don’t write the sequil I will write it and send it to the Mutual
people who put the first part on. I am certain they will take it because I
will make it just so strong and powerful a sermon against the evils of
drink as what you did. With best regards and hopes for your future success,
I am your friend,

Death
</h2>

</div>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">I</span> have always wished to know of death. I have always wondered what
became of me when I went back to earth. Today I know.
</p>

<p>
I have watched a soul die and have heard its pain. Beside it I have stood
and listened to its cries. I have watched it sicken and have noted how it
struggled.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-37" class="pagenum" title="37"></a>
Life was beautiful to it. There never was so exquisite a soul. It
leaped, and burned and danced when it was born. It was so radiant the dark
world into which it came grew light.
</p>

<p>
I have always wished to know of death. Today I know.
</p>

<p>
It was raining softly and we sat within a room with pictures all about—a
woman, fresh and young, and I—and trembled. The beauty and the
loveliness of her were dawning in me. And something of myself that
had not been took being. I loved. There was nothing as beautiful as her
lips. There was nothing as beautiful as her eyes. There was nothing then
in all the world as beautiful as she I loved. It was my soul. Restless as
a song it reached from day to day to light new moments with its melody.
Ever and forever it went singing, “I will live beyond the stars. I will live
beyond the mystery of flesh. When the woman who awakened me is
turned to dust I will live as now and sing as now.”
</p>

<p>
I have always wondered what became of me when I went back to
earth. Today I know.
</p>

<p>
It was so precious and so fierce. I loved so. I had but to look on her
and taste of immortality.
</p>

<p>
Beside it I have stood and listened to its cries. I have noted how it
struggled. In the night I have repeated its brave words, “Ever and forever.”
I have nursed it from her lips. I have given it to feed upon her breast.
</p>

<p>
It would not live. I loved so, I loved so—and yet I ceased to love.
</p>

<p>
There is one thing in the world that will not live. There is one thing
mortal more than life. It is the beauty of which poets sing. Beauty dies
in every moment. It is mortal with the hours. It flashes and it dies. It
leaps and dies. It sings and dies.
</p>

<p>
I loved so and yet I ceased to love.
</p>

<p>
Her eyes became as nothing. Her lips became as nothing. Her voice
became as nothing. Her laughter and her tears, the movement of her body
when she walked, the strangeness of her face, the mysteries that made her
one apart and glorified her and the radiance that burned in me at her approach—all
became as nothing.
</p>

<p>
Miserable God. False Promiser. I have wished to know of death.
I have wondered what became of me when I went back to earth. Today
I know.

Children’s Poems
</h2>

</div>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">A</span><span class="postfirstchar">lice</span> Oliver Henderson, eight-year-old poet, wrote the following
five poems when she was only seven. Her method is to chant
them to her mother, Alice Corbin Henderson, who takes them down exactly
as they are dictated. Mrs. Henderson thinks their interest lies in the fact
that they are the expression of a child’s mind, and so she refuses to change
or “improve” them. Besides, it might be difficult to “improve” such lines
as “The moon shines against my heart”.... The other poems in the
group were written by Percy Mackaye’s children—Arvia’s at the age of
ten, and Robin’s at twelve. Mr. Mackaye says that his daughter’s were
done while it was still difficult for her to read or write, but that she has
always been read aloud to and has learned considerable poetry by heart.

<em>Irradiations: Sand and Spray, by John Gould Fletcher.
Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company.</em>
</p>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">T</span><span class="postfirstchar">here</span> is considerable diversity in Mr. Fletcher’s <em>Irradiations</em>, but one
soon discovers that he has not encrimsoned himself with the standard passions
of poetry. He does not display the usual contortions of love, hate,
grief, and fear. Some persons have, therefore, found him aloof, oversubtle,
and lacking in emotional force. This intimation that Mr. Fletcher’s art is
etiolated is an admission of the reader’s incompleteness. Vitality does not
depend on subject; nor is subtlety necessarily weakness. But the notion
strangely persists that a poet must clothe his emotions in samite and dance
with them around a blood-red fire to the plangent accompaniment of drums
and trumpets.
</p>

<p>
To say that Mr. Fletcher has entwined himself with nature would unfairly
give an impression of Wordsworthian insipidity. Yet Mr. Fletcher
in many of his poems is a part of the rain, of the sand and wind, of the
clouds and sky. But he is never merely descriptive. He has the power of
conveying a mood in the terms of nature without intruding himself upon
the reader. Let me illustrate with one of the best of his poems which has
been much quoted elsewhere:
</p>

      <div class="stanza">
      <p class="verse">The winds came clanging and clattering</p>
      <p class="verse">From long white highroads whipping in ribbons up summits;</p>

      <p class="verse">And the rustling of innumerable translucent leaves.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="stanza">
      <p class="verse">Uneven tinkling, the lazy rain</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">
Our tread-mill versifiers will shrink and mumble in the presence of Mr.
Fletcher’s clean new poetry. They who have inherited the dead mottled skin
of old poetic form with its incrustation of ancient allusions, symbols, and
yellowed figures, will not feel the alluring freshness of a poem such as this:
</p>

<div class="excerpt">

      <p class="verse">Indefatigable after all these years!</p>
      <p class="verse">Here upon earth there is life, and then death,</p>

      <p class="verse">If the idea fits my fancy?</p>
      <p class="verse">Dawns of marvellous light, wakeful, sleepy, weary, dancing dawns;</p>
      <p class="verse">You are rose petals settling through the blue of my evening;</p>
      <p class="verse">I light my pipe to salute you,</p>

      </div>
    </div>

<p class="noindent">
In his preface Mr. Fletcher says the use of rhyme is in its essence
barbarous; yet he himself uses it not infrequently together with such devices
as assonance, onomatopoeia, and alliteration. He is not inconsistent,
however, for he admits that rhyme used intelligently will add to the richness
of effect. It does:

<em>Sand and Spray: A Sea-Symphony</em> comprises the second part of Mr.
Fletcher’s volume. This symphony has much of the movement and variety
of music. In manner it resembles many of the “Irradiations,” and it is
just as well worth reading.

Certainly there will be many who will not like Mr. Fletcher’s work.
Dogs will always bark at a new fragrance.

<p class="noindent">
Readers of Lafcadio Hearn will recall the many translations of Japanese
<em>haikai</em> poetry which are scattered through his writings. Those translations
have been collected in the present volume. They are delicate whisps
of thought, tantalizingly suggestive, most of them confined to a sentence.
Here are some of them:

The following poem, says the editor, was written more than eleven

Some discerning persons have asserted that “Imagism” is derived from
<em>haikai</em> or <em>hokku</em> poetry. We shall leave to them the pleasant futility of discussing
that theory. They may eventually discover that they are building on
the shaky premise that “Imagism” exists other than as a clever word.

<p class="from">
<em>Lee J. Smits, Detroit</em>:
</p>

<p>
We are disgusted and impatient with “peo-pul” just to the extent that our realization
of superiority fails us. That impatient attitude reminds me of the ordinary
attitude of the white toward the black. The white man is not sure of himself; history
and biology do not give him sufficient support. So he bullies negroes at every
opportunity. Some men even are impelled to contend for their superiority by
abusing dogs.
</p>

<p>
The sense of superiority abides in all living things of necessity, else no form of
life would stand out against any other. Wild creatures never need argue, each with
himself, as to his place in the world. His right to exist and to express himself is
paramount in the animal’s soul. Only man ever doubts.
</p>

<p>
Really “peo-pul” do not doubt. They with the artist’s mark on them do the
doubting. When it is very faint, their doubting asserts itself in strange ways and the
crude egoism thereof revolts us. “Peo-pul” crawl along self-satisfied.
</p>

<p>
And why do you ask so much of artists? Why is it so important that they should
use their strength in vain strivings to make butterflies of worms never destined to be
butterflies or to amuse other artists who should be able to amuse themselves? If they
get joy out of creating and preaching, let them preach and create—let them soar.
If they get joy out of being, out of exultant living and watching, let them live, and
do not scold.
</p>

<p>
The most beautiful butterfly I ever saw (some kind of “Emperor”) merely rested
on a lump of mud in the forest shade and very languidly moved his wings. That is
all he did while I looked at him. He knew that he could fly, I knew that he could
fly, and he either knew that I knew or else he didn’t care.
</p>

<p>
We all know what impatience with “peo-pul” is. In the hush of a great flash of
dramatic power from the stage, they giggle, and it would be good to fasten your
fingers in the pulpy throat of one. They applaud idiotic vaudeville, and it would be
glorious to arise, automatic in hand, and slay and slay.
</p>

<p>
That is your distrust of yourself—we all have it as much as we deserve it.
</p>

<p>
“So I belong to this species!” you say.
</p>

<p>
I do not hate my dog when he seeks out carrion. I wash him with strong soap
and try to explain him. I feel quite sure—most of the time—that I have come a little
further than he has.
</p>

<p>
“Peo-pul” are even more interesting than dogs, when taken individually. We
even have more in common with them than with other animals.
</p>

<p>
Some of them are beautiful in their simplicity, like children—unspoiled in their
loves and hates, and it is entertainment to behold them; to be with them, yet not of
them; to be the arch-snob, of such perfect snobbishness that it is indistinguishable
from perfect humility, perfect democracy.
</p>

<p>
All the mighty ones have been artists in life; like unto children they have walked
their ways, so everlastingly sure of themselves that rarely have they been betrayed
into petulance by the wobbling of their sense of superiority.
</p>

<em>Susan Quackenbush, Portage, Wisconsin</em>:
</p>

<p>
May one who has read your every issue with joy and enthusiasm be permitted to
<a id="page-48" class="pagenum" title="48"></a>
enter protest against that gross libel on the human race labeled <em>The Artist in Life</em>,
in your June number?
</p>

<p>
Please—oh please—<em>be</em> an artist-in-life, in human life, as well as in sunsets and
Paderewskis and Imagism, and see for one creative moment, in “terms of truth and
beauty,” the wonderful, aspiring, suffering, loving, smouldering, flaming beautiful
souls of that great living, growing, winged group of creations you have called—may
the great human God forgive the phrase—a “mass of caterpillars!” Come and see
how its soul, and the souls of its separate creations “spring from the rock” just as
truly as the brook’s or your own. If they can not <em>yet</em> spring as far, it is because the
weight above them is as yet too heavy.
</p>

<p>
When all the humans look like caterpillars to any one human, the trouble is with
that one’s viewpoint. From an aeroplane, even the Himalayas look like anthills. Come
down from your remote altitude and lose yourself in the beautiful, glorious psychic
of the crowd—be one of them, and see what you will find!
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span> proclaims itself bent on the adventure of beauty. Is there
any beauty like that of the “sad, sweet music of humanity?” What is the glow of
the most gorgeous sunset ever splashed against the western skies beside the glow of
the divine in the human which hurls itself upon you—and <em>into</em> you if you will let
it—in a thousand beseeching, inviting, intoxicating flames from the midst of any
crowd?
</p>

<p>
But only, of course, if you are <em>in</em> the midst.
</p>

<p>
Is there any adventure like the “adventure of being human”—and <em>with</em> humans?
and <em>of</em> them? Go with Whitman into the heart of humanity—struggle <em>with</em> them—not
from far above them—to lift from off their backs the crushing weight of wealth
and masters and idle snobs and false gods so that they may get <em>room</em> to spread their
wings—for they <em>have</em> wings, and then you will know them as they are, and yourself
but as one of them.
</p>

<p>
If some of them still try to clip the wings of those who have struggled free from
the crushing pressure, it is because of the maddening agony of their own atrophying
wings. If a few seem even to be unaware of the need for wings, it is because the
clamor of more insistent needs—the cries of hungry children, of bruised and broken
and unsatisfied men and of suffering and degraded women—has silenced for every
shame their own soul’s wing-cry.
</p>

<p>
But I think that you will find that those who perform the wing-clipping are the
other butterflies whom money or position or callousness has set above the people—not
those who are really of the crowd. They of the crowd <em>love</em> wings, and those who
truly use them.
</p>

<p>
I am not daring to attempt reply to the statement which inflames me most, lest
I become profane and entirely incoherent. I mean, of course, the statement that the
estimate of four or five thousand living artists would be too optimistic because that
would mean four or five thousand who “have nothing in common with caterpillars.”
That’s a worse libel on artists than the rest of it is on people. But I’ll try to stop
with one remark and one question. The estimate is entirely too pessimistic; I positively
refuse to believe there are four thousand persons alive who have or even who
think they have “nothing in common” with the great splendid mass of folks; if there
are, the gods have pity on them! And—has there ever been one single real and great
artist, whether of brush or pen or tone, whose art and whose very greatness was not
absolutely dependent upon and because of the fact that he had, and knew he had,
<em>everything</em> in common with, and indeed included in his being, the beings of these
whom you term “caterpillars”?—these whose life and living are and always have been
and through ages will continue to be the most worth while content of all art? Of
course you reply: <em>Nietzsche</em>; but he was an intellectual and spiritual Rockefeller—not
an artist-in-life.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-49" class="pagenum" title="49"></a>
And Individualism? When <em>all</em> have been set free to use their wings, then the
few may feel free to strive toward the super-butterfly. And when they arrive, perhaps,—oh,
just perhaps—they will find all the other “caterpillars” there too, and with
quite wonderful wings. There are wings, and wings, and if they but serve to bear
us free of the disaster of meanness and cruelty and snobbishness and injustice, who
shall say they are not super-wings?
</p>

<p class="from">
<em>Witter Bynner, Windsor, Vermont</em>:
</p>

<p>
I wish I could honor the Imagists as you do. Hueffer wrote <em>On Heaven</em> (not
imagistic); and Pound wrote well before he affected a school ... Pound has a
rhythm he can’t kill. But none of them, except Hueffer, says anything worth mentioning.
They build poems around phrases, usually around adjectives. George Meredith
has thousands of imagist poems incidental to each of his novels. But he knows their
use and their beauty. These people wring tiny beauties dry. I can imagine a good
poet using their methods on occasion, but he wouldn’t be so damn conscious about it.
On the whole, the Imagists strike me as being purveyors of more or less potent
cosmetics, their whole interest being in the cosmetic itself, not even in its application.
Poetry gave signs of becoming poetry again and of touching life—when these fellows
showed up, to make us all ridiculous.

Pearls from <em>The Outlook</em> for August 11, in regard to the Becker trial:
</p>

  <div class="excerpt">
<p class="noindent">
What can we learn from this story of trust betrayed,
of dishonor in high places, and of a three years’ legal
battle over a crime which demanded immediate retribution?
Certainly the law did not come out unscathed from
this controversy. It is a familiar story, but it will bear
repetition until it is remedied—we are very much behind
England in our administration of criminal law. The
efficiency of punishment as a deterrent to crime is largely
based upon the swiftness and sureness of justice rather
than the severity of the penalty inflicted. Becker is
dead; but who can deny that whatever social effect may
result from his execution would have been trebled had
his death come within a reasonable interval after the
commission of his crime? The case is significant, not
because it is an exception, but because it is typical of
the process of American law.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright

so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that:

        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &bull; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
